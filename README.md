# PrototypeRepo 
This is a prototype project developed for automating consumption based pricing system, which takes order details and usage data from datadump and generate input for Java services using python. which then generates bill information and create SAP input file.

I have checked in two parts of the projects.
  a. Java Service which can be hosted on the server.
  b. Html and JS files has to hosted on same server to avoid Cross scripting errors while calling services
  c. the python files can be stored on the server to extract Data from the data dump files.
  Please install python runtime for running python files
  DB scripts are stored in the same repo and which can be used to create the database tables.
